# About Me Take One

## Description

This is a simple website showcasing some of my skills with bootstrap and my work as a developer. I have been working as a web developer for over 100 years and have made thousands of sites. Because of this, I need a single site to show off some of my successes.

## Usage

If you click on the porfolio page you will find links that will allow you to dive into some of my work and my travels. The first one "Travels" showcases my work as a photographer while wandering the globe. You will see here my vast knowledge of photoshop and my keen eye for beauty and wonder.

In the next section you shall find some examples of some big name websites that I have single handedly built!

The next two links will take you through some of my beautiful and flawless code followed by a link to my repositories.

## Credits

I would like to thank my teaching staff and peers for all of their help keeping me from banging my head against my laptop!
